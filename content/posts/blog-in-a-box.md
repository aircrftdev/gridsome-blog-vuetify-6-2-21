### Markdown button test


[button url="http://www.google.com"]


{% include button.html url="http://www.google.com" %}


The third option is to write plain HTML:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<button name="button" onclick="http://www.google.com">Click me</button>



Option 4. The markdown way

The last option is to use markdown to add a class and use CSS to style the link as a button.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

[Click me](http://www.google.com){: .btn}


<button name="button">Click me</button>


Use the include option (2) that JoostS recommended. Here's more specific info that shows how to incorporate a button using includes with parameters. In your _includes folder, create your button template (e.g., button.html), such as this:

<button type="button" class="btn btn-{{include.button_class}} active">{{include.button_name}}</button>
(This HTML code assumes you're using Bootstrap for your buttons.)

Those places where I've written {{include.button_name}} will be the parameters you pass into your include.

Now on your Markdown page, include your button like this:

{% include button.html button_name="My Button" button_class="primary" %}
I use this technique for callouts, images, and alerts in my documentation. Basically any time you have complex HTML formatting, you can hide it away in an include template like this.
